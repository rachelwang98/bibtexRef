  abstract     = {Currently, there is debate among scholars regarding how to operationalize
	and measure executive functions. These functions generally are referred
	to as "supervisory" cognitive processes because they involve higher
	level organization and execution of complex thoughts and behavior.
	Although conceptualizations vary regarding what mental processes
	actually constitute the "executive function" construct, there has
	been a historical linkage of these "higher-level" processes with
	the frontal lobes. In fact, many investigators have used the term
	"frontal functions" synonymously with "executive functions" despite
	evidence that contradicts this synonymous usage. The current review
	provides a critical analysis of lesion and neuroimaging studies using
	three popular executive function measures (Wisconsin Card Sorting
	Test, Phonemic Verbal Fluency, and Stroop Color Word Interference
	Test) in order to examine the validity of the executive function
	construct in terms of its relation to activation and damage to the
	frontal lobes. Empirical lesion data are examined via meta-analysis
	procedures along with formula derivatives. Results reveal mixed evidence
	that does not support a one-to-one relationship between executive
	functions and frontal lobe activity. The paper concludes with a discussion
	of the implications of construing the validity of these neuropsychological
	tests in anatomical, rather than cognitive and behavioral, terms.},

	These inhibitory processes have been shown to cause long-lasting
	forgetting of “distracting�? memories that interfere during our attempts

	processes may form the basis of some instances of traumatic forgetting,

	in the study of amnesia for childhood sexual abuse: the greater incidence
	of forgetting for betrayal traumas than for abuse perpetrated by

  abstract     = {This review paper outlines the issues associated with the assessment
	of executive function (EF) in children and adolescents, and describes
	the developmental profile of executive processes across childhood.
	At the outset, EF is defined, and cognitive and behavioral impairments
	associated with executive dysfunction (EDF) are described. A developmental
	model of EF is proposed incorporating four discrete but inter-related
	executive domains (attentional control, cognitive flexibility, goal
	setting, and information processing) which operate in an integrative
	manner to enable "executive control". Characteristics that constitute
	traditional EF measures are discussed, as are the problems associated
	with test interpretation. The ecological validity of EF tests and
	neuropsychological assessment procedures are examined, and adjunct
	methods of measurement are presented to enable a more comprehensive
	and valid assessment of EF. Based on developmental and normative
	studies, the maturation of executive domains is mapped. Attentional
	control appears to emerge in infancy and develop rapidly in early
	childhood. In contrast, cognitive flexibility, goal setting, and
	information processing experience a critical period of development
	between 7 and 9 years of age, and are relatively mature by 12 years
	of age. A transitional period is thought to occur at the beginning
	of adolescence, and shortly after "executive control" is likely to
	emerge. In order to confirm our current understanding of EF development
	and further enhance our understanding of brain-behavior relationships,
	longitudinal studies incorporating structural and functional neuroimaging
	are required.},

	the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC); that patients with ADHD
	have significant response inhibition deficits and show altered functional
	activation and gray matter volumes in right IFC; and that a number
	of studies indicate that response inhibition performance is heritable.
	Additionally, we review evidence concerning the role of the basal
	ganglia in response inhibition, as well as the role of neuromodulatory
	systems. All things considered, a combined right IFC structure/function/response
	inhibition phenotype is a particularly good candidate for future
	heritability and association studies. Moreover, a dissection of response
	inhibition into more basic components such as rule maintenance, vigilance,

	recording. We measured peak latency, amplitude, and topographic distribution
	of the components, and analyzed the neural sources using low-resolution
	electromagnetic tomography.Results: There were no differences between
	the Go and NoGo conditions in the latency, amplitude, scalp topography,
	or the electrical source localization of the P1 and N1 components.
	The N2 component was seen only in the NoGo ERP, and its source
	was located in the right lateral orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex.
	The NoGo-P3 component had larger amplitude and longer latency,
	and was more anteriorly localized than Go-P3; Go-P3 was located
	mainly in the medial part of the parietal cortex, whereas the NoGo-P3
	activity was observed in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex.Conclusions:

	in 325 participants (roughly 30 per age from 4 to 13 years and young

	designed to manipulate memory and inhibition independently and together,
	in steady state (single-task blocks) and during task-switching, and
	to be appropriate over the lifespan and for neuroimaging (fMRI).
	This is one of the first studies, in children or adults, to explore:
	(a) how memory requirements interact with spatial compatibility and
	(b) spatial incompatibility effects both with stimulus-specific rules
	(Simon task) and with higher-level, conceptual rules. Even the
	youngest children could hold information in mind, inhibit a dominant
	response, and combine those as long as the inhibition required was
	steady-state and the rules remained constant. Cognitive flexibility
	(switching between rules), even with memory demands minimized, showed
	a longer developmental progression, with 13-year-olds still not at
	adult levels. Effects elicited only in Mixed blocks with adults were
	found in young children even in single-task blocks; while young children
	could exercise inhibition in steady state it exacted a cost not seen
	in adults, who (unlike young children) seemed to re-set their default
	response when inhibition of the same tendency was required throughout
	a block. The costs associated with manipulations of inhibition were
	greater in young children while the costs associated with increasing

	slowed down on difficult trials to preserve accuracy; but the youngest
	children were impulsive; their RT remained more constant but at
	an accuracy cost on difficult trials. Contrary to our predictions
	of independence between memory and inhibition, when matched for difficulty
	RT correlations between these were as high as 0.8, although accuracy
	correlations were less than half that. Spatial incompatibility effects
	and global and local switch costs were evident in children and adults,

  abstract     = {ObjectiveThe dual pathway model explains neuro-psychological heterogeneity
	in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in terms of
	dissociable cognitive and motivational deficits each affecting some
	but not other patients. We explore whether deficits in temporal processing
	might constitute a third dissociable neuropsychological component
	of ADHD.MethodNine tasks designed to tap three domains (inhibitory
	control, delay aversion and temporal processing) were administered
	to ADHD probands (n=71; ages 6 to 17 years), their siblings (n=71;
	65 unaffected by ADHD) and a group of non-ADHD controls (n=50).
	IQ and working memory were measured.ResultsTemporal processing,
	inhibitory control and delay-related deficits represented independent
	neuropsychological components. ADHD children differed from controls
	on all factors. For ADHD patients, the co-occurrence of inhibitory,
	temporal processing and delay-related deficits was no greater than
	expected by chance with substantial groups of patients showing only
	one problem. Domain-specific patterns of familial co-segregation
	provided evidence for the validity of neuropsychological subgroupings.ConclusionThe
	current results illustrate the neuropsychological heterogeneity in
	ADHD and initial support for a triple pathway model. The findings
	need to be replicated in larger samples.},

  abstract     = {Research and clinical investigations in psychiatry largely rely on
	the de facto assumption that the diagnostic categories identified
	in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) represent homogeneous
	syndromes. However, the mechanistic heterogeneity that potentially
	underlies the existing classification scheme might limit discovery
	of etiology for most developmental psychiatric disorders. Another,
	perhaps less palpable, reality may also be interfering with progress-heterogeneity
	in typically developing populations. In this report we attempt to
	clarify neuropsychological heterogeneity in a large dataset of typically
	developing youth and youth with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
	(ADHD), using graph theory and community detection. We sought to
	determine whether data-driven neuropsychological subtypes could be
	discerned in children with and without the disorder. Because individual
	classification is the sine qua non for eventual clinical translation,
	we also apply support vector machine-based multivariate pattern analysis
	to identify how well ADHD status in individual children can be
	identified as defined by the community detection delineated subtypes.
	The analysis yielded several unique, but similar subtypes across
	both populations. Just as importantly, comparing typically developing
	children with ADHD children within each of these distinct subgroups
	increased diagnostic accuracy. Two important principles were identified
	that have the potential to advance our understanding of typical development
	and developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. The first tenet suggests
	that typically developing children can be classified into distinct
	neuropsychological subgroups with high precision. The second tenet
	proposes that some of the heterogeneity in individuals with ADHD
	might be "nested" in this normal variation.},

	the quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging
	from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical
	modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability,
	and even purpose of SEM. Guidelines for implementing the expanded
	capabilities of SEM are currently lacking. In this paper we describe
	new developments in SEM that we believe constitute a third-generation
	of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the
	generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph.
	In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles
	rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels
	and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries
	and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a
	graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood
	methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the
	goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling
	process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification
	choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options,
	and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for
	prospective analyses. The illustrative example presented involves
	monitoring data from wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia
	National Park. Our presentation walks through the decision process
	involved in developing and evaluating models, as well as drawing
	inferences from the resulting prediction equations. In addition to
	evaluating hypotheses about the connections between human activities
	and biotic responses, we illustrate how the structural equation (SE)
	model can be queried to understand how interventions might take advantage
	of an environmental threshold to limit Typha invasions. The guidelines
	presented provide for an updated definition of the SEM process
	that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a graph-theory
	implementation. The implementation is also designed to permit complex
	specifications and to be compatible with various estimation methods.
	Finally, they are meant to foster the use of probabilistic reasoning
	in both retrospective and prospective considerations of the quantitative
	implications of the results.},

	reviewed in this article probes the control processes that reconfigure
	mental resources for a change of task by requiring subjects to switch
	frequently among a small set of simple tasks. Subjects' responses
	are substantially slower and, usually, more error-prone immediately
	after a task switch. This ‘switch cost�? is reduced, but not eliminated,
	by an opportunity for preparation. It seems to result from both transient
	and long-term carry-over of ‘task-set�? activation and inhibition
	as well as time consumed by task-set reconfiguration processes. Neuroimaging
	studies of task switching have revealed extra activation in numerous
	brain regions when subjects prepare to change tasks and when they
	perform a changed task, but we cannot yet separate ‘controlling�?
	from ‘controlled�? regions.},

	We present an automatic, auto-calibrating algorithm that allows efficient
	analysis of such data sets. Methods The auto-calibration is based
	on automatic threshold value estimation. Amplitude threshold values
	for saccades and blinks are determined based on features in the recorded
	signal. The performance of the developed algorithm was tested by
	analyzing 4854 saccades and 213 blinks recorded in two different
	conditions: a task where the eye movements were controlled (saccade
	task) and a task with free viewing (multitask). The results were
	compared with results from a video-oculography (VOG) device and
	manually scored blinks. Results The algorithm achieved 93% detection
	sensitivity for blinks with 4% false positive rate. The detection
	sensitivity for horizontal saccades was between 98% and 100 and
	for oblique saccades between 95% and 100%. The classification sensitivity
	for horizontal and large oblique saccades (10 deg) was larger than
	89 and for vertical saccades larger than 82%. The duration and
	peak velocities of the detected horizontal saccades were similar
	to those in the literature. In the multitask measurement the detection
	sensitivity for saccades was 97% with a 6% false positive rate.
	Conclusion The developed algorithm enables reliable analysis of EOG
	data recorded both during EEG and as a separate metrics.},

	Here we demonstrate that measuring multisensory performance using

	multisensory performance: the first index (MRE*) is based on an
	arithmetic combination of RT and DR, the second (MPE) is constructed

	by data from two audio-visual experiments. In the first, a redundant
	targets detection experiment using stimuli of different intensity,
	both measures yield similar pattern of results supporting the "principle
	of inverse effectiveness". The second experiment, introducing stimulus
	onset asynchrony and differing instructions (focused attention vs.
	redundant targets task) further supports the usefulness of both indices.
	Statistical properties of both measures are investigated via bootstrapping

	were used to measure the degree to which the subjective value of
	a large reward decreased as one had to wait longer for it (TD),
	and as the probability of obtaining it decreased (PD). Rewards
	used were small amounts of money. In the TD task, the large reward
	(10 cents) was delayed by between 0 and 30s, and the immediate reward
	varied in magnitude (0�?10 cents). In the PD task, receipt of the
	large reward (10 cents) varied in likelihood, with probabilities
	of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 used, and the certain reward varied
	in magnitude (0�?10 cents).Age and diagnostic group did not affect
	the degree of PD of rewards: All participants made choices so that
	total gains were maximized. As predicted, young children, aged 6�?11
	years (n=25) demonstrated steeper TD of rewards than adolescents,
	aged 12�?17 years (n=21). This effect remained significant even when
	choosing the immediate reward did not shorten overall task duration.
	This, together with the lack of interaction between TD task version
	and age, suggests that steeper discounting in young children is driven
	by reward immediacy and not by delay aversion. Contrary to our predictions,
	participants with ADHD (n=22) did not demonstrate steeper TD
	of rewards than controls (n=24).These results raise the possibility
	that strong preferences for small immediate rewards in ADHD, as
	found in previous research, depend on factors such as total maximum
	gain and the use of fixed versus varied delay durations. The decrease
	in TD as observed in adolescents compared to children may be related
	to developmental changes in the (dorsolateral) prefrontal cortex.
	Future research needs to investigate these possibilities.},

	discounting of gains, probability discounting of losses, and delay
	discounting of gains. Each task used an adjusting-amount procedure,
	and participants' choices affected the amount and timing of their
	remuneration for participating. Both group and individual discounting
	functions from all three procedures were well fitted by hyperboloid
	discounting functions. A negative correlation between the probability
	discounting of gains and losses was observed, consistent with the
	idea that individuals' choices on probability discounting tasks reflect
	their general attitude towards risk, regardless of whether the outcomes
	are gains or losses. This finding further suggests that risk attitudes
	reflect the weighting an individual gives to the lowest-valued outcome
	(e.g., getting nothing when the probabilistic outcome is a gain or
	actually losing when the probabilistic outcome is a loss). According
	to this view, risk-aversion indicates a tendency to overweight the
	lowest-valued outcome, whereas risk-seeking indicates a tendency
	to underweight it. Neither probability discounting of gains nor probability
	discounting of losses were reliably correlated with discounting of
	delayed gains, a result that is inconsistent with the idea that probability
	discounting and delay discounting both reflect a general tendency
	towards impulsivity.},

	functions (e.g. executive; seat of wisdom); others contested that
	the frontal lobes played no special role. There has also been controversy
	about the unity or diversity of functions related to the frontal
	lobes. Based on the analysis of the effects of lesions of the frontal
	lobes, we propose that there are discrete categories of functions
	within the frontal lobes, of which ‘executive�? functioning is one.
	Within the executive category, the data do not support the concept
	of an undifferentiated central executive/supervisory system. The
	results are better explained as impairments in a collection of anatomically

	processes. Evidence for three separate frontal attentional processes
	is presented. For each process, we present an operational description,
	the data supporting the distinctiveness of each process and the evidence
	for impairments of each process after lesions in specific frontal
	regions. These processes and their coarse frontal localizations are
	energization—superior medial, task setting—left lateral and monitoring—right
	lateral. The strength of the findings lies in replication: across
	different tasks; across different cognitive modalities (e.g. reaction
	time paradigms, memory); and across different patient groups. This
	convergence minimizes the possibility that any of the findings are
	limited to a specific task or to a specific set of patients. Although

	50 children with ADHD (31 ADHD, 19 ADHD+RD) and age-matched
	healthy controls (n = 50) completed three psychophysical tasks: duration
	discrimination (target duration of 400 ms versus a foil duration),
	frequency discrimination (a control condition to evaluate general
	perceptual ability), and a duration estimation task using the method
	of reproduction for intervals of 400 ms, 2000 ms, and 6000 ms. Study
	2 used the same tasks with an adolescent sample (35 ADHD, 24 ADHD+RD,
	39 controls). Results: In both studies, children and adolescents
	with ADHD and ADHD+RD displayed some impairments in duration
	discrimination and the precision with which they reproduced the intervals
	on the estimation task, particularly the shorter 400 ms interval.
	The most severe impairments tended to occur in the comorbid ADHD+RD
	group. No impairments were found on the frequency discrimination
	task. ADHD participants also displayed significant intra-individual
	variability in their performance on the estimation task. Finally,
	short-term and working memory, estimated full-scale IQ, and teacher
	report of hyperactivity/impulsivity were found to differentially
	predict performance on the time perception measures in the adolescent
	clinical sample. Conclusions: Deficits in duration discrimination,
	duration estimation, and intra-individual performance variability
	may have cascaded effects on the temporal organisation of behaviour
	in children and adolescents with ADHD and ADHD+RD.},

	first on a visual choice reaction task in which the spatial mapping
	between the go signal and response was varied between blocks. The
	choice task was then complicated by randomly inserting a visual stop
	signal on 30% of the trials. In the simple stop signal paradigm,
	the stop signal required the inhibition of the planned response.
	In the selective stop signal paradigm, the stop signal required response
	inhibition only when the stop signal was presented at the same side
	as the instructed response to the go signal. The results showed that
	simple stopping was faster than selective stopping and that selective,
	but not simple, stopping of incompatible responses was slower than
	stopping of compatible responses. Brinley plot analysis yielded linear
	functions relating children’s latencies to adults�? latencies. Analysis
	of shared variance indicated that developmental change in the speed
	of selective stopping continued to be significant even when the effect
	associated with simple stopping was removed. This pattern of findings
	is discussed vis-à-vis notions of global versus specific developmental
	trends in the speed of information processing.},

To overcome this issue, we present software called STOP-IT, for running the stop-signal task, as well as an additional analyzing program called ANALYZE-IT. The main advantage of both programs is that they are a precompiled executable, and for basic use there is no need for additional programming.

  abstract     = {Two competing theoretical models of individual differences in executive functioning (EF) were examined: the Prefrontal Convexity Model and the Hemispheric Asymmetry Model. Neurologically healthy individuals (N = 315; mean age 20.8) completed a modified switching task (MST) and the Attention Network Test (ANT) in a single testing session. Data analysis was conducted in two phases. In the first phase (model identification), latent profile analysis was applied to MST variables measuring the abilities to form, switch, and maintain mental sets under conditions designed to tax left or right hemisphere resources. In the second phase (model validation), participant clusters obtained from the first phase were compared on the ANT. The Model Identification phase yielded a 3-profile solution consistent with the Hemispheric Asymmetry Model. Profile 1 (N = 203) was characterized by average EF performances. Profile 2 (N = 43) revealed a set maintenance weakness under non-verbal conditions. Profile 3 (N = 38) demonstrated weaknesses in cognitive flexibility combined with poor executive performances under verbal conditions. The Model Validation phase confirmed group differences. Profile 1 demonstrated average EF performances. Profile 2 demonstrated distractibility and decreased alertness, consistent with a right hemisphere weakness. Profile 3 demonstrated cognitive rigidity in the absence of external cues, consistent with a left hemisphere weakness. Individual differences in EF appear to follow a Hemispheric Asymmetry Model of EF among neurologically healthy adults. Investigating the relationship between hemispherically mediated executive functions and other individual difference factors known to confer health risk or resilience could inform numerous disciplines within the field of psychology.},

  abstract     = {Background: Diagnostic and prognostic or predictive models serve different purposes. Whereas diagnostic models are usually used for classification, prognostic models incorporate the dimension of time, adding a stochastic element. Content: The ROC curve is typically used to evaluate clinical utility for both diagnostic and prognostic models. This curve assesses how well a test or model discriminates, or separates individuals into two classes, such as diseased and nondiseased. A strong risk predictor, such as lipids for cardiovascular disease, may have limited impact on the area under the curve, called the AUC or c-statistic, even if it alters predicted values. Calibration, measuring whether predicted probabilities agree with observed proportions, is another component of model accuracy important to assess. Reclassification can directly compare the clinical impact of two models by determining how many individuals would be reclassified into clinically relevant risk strata. For example, adding high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and family history to prediction models for cardiovascular disease using traditional risk factors moves approximately 30% of those at intermediate risk levels, such as 50% or 100% 10-year risk, into higher or lower risk categories, despite little change in the c-statistic. A calibration statistic can asses how well the new predicted values agree with those observed in the cross-classified data. Summary: Although it is useful for classification, evaluation of prognostic models should not rely solely on the ROC curve, but should assess both discrimination and calibration. Risk reclassification can aid in comparing the clinical impact of two models on risk for the individual, as well as the population.},

  abstract     = {Anxious stress compromises cognitive executive performance. This occurs, for instance, in cognitive performance anxiety (CPA), in which anxiety about one's cognitive performance causes that performance to actually deteriorate (e.g., test anxiety). This is thought to result from a prefrontal cortically (PFC) mediated failure of top-down attentional control over stress-induced automatic processing of threat-related information. In addition, stress-induced increased catecholamine influx into the PFC may directly compromise attentional function. Previous research has suggested that the ratio between resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) low- and high-frequency power (the theta/beta ratio) is related to trait attentional control, which might moderate these effects of stress on attentional function. The goals of the present study were to test the novel prediction that theta/beta ratio moderates the deleterious effects of CPA-like anxious stress on state attentional control and to replicate a previous finding that the theta/beta ratio is related to self-reported trait attentional control. After recording of baseline frontal EEG signals, 77 participants performed a stress induction or a control procedure. Trait attentional control was assessed with the Attentional Control Scale, whereas stress-induced changes in attentional control and anxiety were measured with self-report visual analogue scales. The hypothesized moderating influence of theta/beta ratio on the effects of stress on state attentional control was confirmed. Theta/beta ratio explained 28% of the variance in stress-induced deterioration of self-reported attentional control. The negative relationship between theta/beta ratio and trait attentional control was replicated (r = --.33). The theta/beta ratio reflects, likely prefrontally mediated, attentional control, and should be a useful biomarker for the study of CPA and other anxiety--cognition interactions.},

  abstract  = {Abstract This survey covers the potential use of neurophysiological changes as a biomarker in four neuropsychiatric diseases (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ)). Great developments have been made in the search of biomarkers in these disorders, especially in AD. Nevertheless, there is a tremendous need to develop an efficient, low-cost, potentially portable, non-invasive biomarker in the diagnosis, course, or treatment of the above-mentioned disorders. Electrophysiological methods would provide a tool that would reflect functional brain dynamic changes within milliseconds and also may be used as an ensemble of biomarkers that is greatly needed in the evaluation of cognitive changes seen in these disorders. The strategies for measuring cognitive changes include spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG), sensory evoked oscillation (SEO), and event-related oscillations (ERO). Further selective connectivity deficit in sensory or cognitive networks is reflected by coherence measurements. Possible candidate biomarkers discussed in an interactive panel can be summarized as follows: for ADHD: (a) elevation of delta and theta, (b) diminished alpha and beta responses in spontaneous EEG; for SZ: (a) decrease of ERO gamma responses, (b) decreased ERO in all other frequency ranges, (c) invariant ERO gamma response in relation to working memory demand; for euthymic BD: (a) decreased event-related gamma coherence, (b) decreased alpha in ERO and in spontaneous EEG; for manic BD: (a) lower alpha and higher beta in ERO, (b) decreased event-related gamma coherence, (c) lower alpha and beta in ERO after valproate; and for AD: (a) decreased alpha and beta, and increased theta and delta in spontaneous EEG, (b) hyperexcitability of motor cortices as shown by transcortical magnetic stimulation, (c) hyperexcitability of visual sensory cortex as indicated by increased SEO theta responses, (d) lower delta ERO, (e) lower delta, theta, and alpha event-related coherence, (f) higher theta synchrony and higher alpha event-related coherence in cholinergically treated AD subjects. In further research in the search for biomarkers, multimodal methods should be introduced to electrophysiology for validation purposes. Also, providing the protocols for standardization and harmonization of user-friendly acquisition or analysis methods that would be applied in larger cohort populations should be used to incorporate these electrophysiologic methods into the clinical criteria. In an extension to conventional anatomical, biochemical and brain imaging biomarkers, the use of neurophysiologic markers may lead to new applications for functional interpretrations and also the possibility to monitor treatments tailored for individuals.},

  abstract     = {Executive dysfunction has been postulated as the core deficit in ADHD, although many deficits in lower order cognitive processes have also been identified. By obtaining an appropriate baseline of lower order cognitive functioning light may be shed on as to whether executive deficits result from problems in lower order and/or higher order cognitive processes. We examined motor inhibition and cognitive flexibility in relation to a baseline measure in 816 children from ADHD and control families. Multiple children in a family were tested in order to examine the familiality of the measures. No evidence was found for deficits in motor inhibition or cognitive flexibility in children with ADHD or their nonaffected siblings: Compared to their baseline speed and accuracy of responding, children with ADHD and their (non)affected siblings were not disproportionally slower or inaccurate when demands for motor inhibition or cognitive flexibility were added to the task. However, children with ADHD and their (non)affected siblings were overall less accurate than controls, which could not be attributed to differences in response speed. This suggests that inaccuracy of responding is characteristic of children having (a familial risk for) ADHD. Motor inhibition and cognitive flexibility as operationalized with mean reaction time were found to be familial. It is concluded that poorer performance on executive tasks in children with ADHD and their (non)affected siblings may result from deficiencies in lower order cognitive processes and not (only) from higher order cognitive processes/executive functions.},

However, a precise characterization of these reconfiguration processes during cognitive function in humans remains elusive. Here, we use a series of techniques developed in the field of “dynamic network neuroscience” to investigate the dynamics of functional brain networks in 344 healthy subjects during a working-memory challenge (the “n-back” task). In contrast to a control condition, in which dynamic changes in cortical networks were spread evenly across systems, the effortful working-memory condition was characterized by a reconfiguration of frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks. This reconfiguration, which characterizes “network flexibility,” employs transient and heterogeneous connectivity between frontal systems, which we refer to as “integration.” Frontal integration predicted neuropsychological measures requiring working memory and executive cognition, suggesting that dynamic network reconfiguration between frontal systems supports those functions. Our results characterize dynamic reconfiguration of large-scale distributed neural circuits during executive cognition in humans and have implications for understanding impaired cognitive function in disorders affecting connectivity, such as schizophrenia or dementia.},

Methods: 12 children with ADHD (age 11.46 ±1.66) participated in the study. Primary outcome measures were stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) for the SST and CPT’s commission errors (%FP). For each participant, we acquired three morning (8:00am) measurements and behavioral observations, separated by two 7-day intervals. Reliability of cognitive measures and behavioral observations was measured using the Intraclass-correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: ICC values for SSRT and %FP were 0.72. Consistency of behavioral observations was much lower (ICC =0.41). Conclusion: Both the SST and the CPT yielded reliable measurements in ADHD children. Our findings lend further support to using these measures in the study of ADHD. (J. of Att. Dis. 2009; 13(2) 137-143)

In addition, it was hypothesized that the CCPT parameters would perform better than a random test (chance) and show fair to moderate utility of classification across the different indices. Participants were 104 children between 6 and 12 years of age who were referred for evaluation of attention problems. The first hypothesis was not supported. There were no significant, positive correlations between the CCPT parameters and parent and teacher ratings of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive behaviors. The second hypothesis was only partially supported. The CCPT Overall Index and the Omission Errors (84\textsuperscript{th} percentile cutoff) performed better than a random test; however, the utility of the CCPT Overall Index only ranged from poor to slight. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed the accuracy of the CCPT to be low. The implications and limitations of this study and future research directions are discussed.},

The neural mechanisms of cognitive control have yet to be fully elucidated, although the prefrontal cortex is known to play a critical role. Here, I review evidence suggesting that a unifying principle regarding the role of various portions of the prefrontal cortex in a wide range of cognitive tasks is the active maintenance in working memory of different types of currently relevant information---from specific stimulus features, to instructional cues, to motivational goals and contexts. I argue that the key to demonstrating the existence of this domain-dependent organization lies in a better understanding of the nature of the representation of this information and the ways in which this information itself controls cognition and behavior.},

Optimal decision-making requires self-control. We propose two hypotheses about the neurobiology of self-control: (i) Goal-directed decisions have their basis in a common value signal encoded in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and (ii) exercising self-control involves the modulation of this value signal by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor brain activity while dieters engaged in real decisions about food consumption. Activity in vmPFC was correlated with goal values regardless of the amount of self-control. It incorporated both taste and health in self-controllers but only taste in nontextendashself-controllers. Activity in DLPFC increased when subjects exercised self-control and correlated with activity in vmPFC.},

The model reproduces a range of experimental observations and shows that the newly discovered feedback projection from external globus pallidus to striatum is crucial for inhibitory control. Moreover, stopping process is enhanced by the cortico-subcortical reverberatory dynamics underlying persistent activity, establishing interdependence between working memory and inhibitory control. Surprisingly, the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) can be adjusted by weights of certain connections but is insensitive to other connections in this complex circuit, suggesting novel circuit-based intervention for inhibitory control deficits associated with mental illness.

Children completed a battery of executive tasks that differed in format and response requirements and in putative working memory and inhibitory control demands. Tasks appeared to be age appropriate, with adequate sensitivity across the range of performance and without floor or ceiling effects. Tests of the relative fit of several alternative models supported a single latent EF construct. Measurement invariance testing revealed less proficient EF in children at higher sociodemographic risk relative to those at lower risk and no differences between boys and girls. At 3 years of age, when EF skills are emerging, EF appears to be a unitary, more domain-general process.},

  abstract     = {The hippocampus is thought to compare predicted events with current perceptual input, generating a mismatch signal when predictions are violated. However, most prior studies have only inferred when predictions occur without directly measuring them. Moreover, an important but unresolved question is whether hippocampal mismatch signals are modulated by the degree to which predictions differ from outcomes. Here we conducted a human fMRI study in which subjects repeatedly studied various word-picture pairs, learning to predict particular pictures (outcomes) from the words (cues). Following initial learning, a subset of cues were paired with a novel, unexpected outcome whereas other cues continued to predict the same outcome. Critically, when outcomes changed, the new outcome was either ‘near’ to the predicted outcome (same visual category as the predicted picture) or ‘far’ from the predicted outcome (different visual category). Using multi-voxel pattern analysis, we indexed cue-evoked reactivation (prediction) within neocortical areas and related these trial-by-trial measures of prediction strength to univariate hippocampal responses to the outcomes. We found that prediction strength positively modulated hippocampal responses to unexpected outcomes, particularly when unexpected outcomes were closetextendashbut not identicaltextendashto the prediction. Hippocampal responses to unexpected outcomes were also associated with a tradeoff in performance during a subsequent memory test: relatively faster retrieval of new (updated) associations but relatively slower retrieval of the original (older) associations. Together, these results indicate that hippocampal mismatch signals reflect a comparison between active predictions and current outcomes and that these signals are most robust when predictions are similar, but not identical, to outcomes.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAlthough the hippocampus is widely thought to signal ‘mismatches’ between memory-based predictions and out- comes, previous research has not directly linked hippocampal mismatch signals to neural measures of prediction strength. Here, we show that hippocampal mismatch signals increase as a function of the strength of predictions in neocortical regions. This increase in hippocampal mismatch signals was particularly robust when outcomes were similar, but not identical, to predictions. These results indicate that hippocampal mismatch signals are driven by both the active generation of predictions as well as the similarity between predictions and outcomes.},

  abstract     = { The application of psychological measures often results in item response data that arguably are consistent with both unidimensional (a single common factor) and multidimensional latent structures (typically caused by parcels of items that tap similar content domains). As such, structural ambiguity leads to seemingly endless “confirmatory” factor analytic studies in which the research question is whether scale scores can be interpreted as reflecting variation on a single trait. An alternative to the more commonly observed unidimensional, correlated traits, or second-order representations of a measure's latent structure is a bifactor model. Bifactor structures, however, are not well understood in the personality assessment community and thus rarely are applied. To address this, herein we (a) describe issues that arise in conceptualizing and modeling multidimensionality, (b) describe exploratory (including Schmid–Leiman [Schmid & Leiman, 1957] and target bifactor rotations) and confirmatory bifactor modeling, (c) differentiate between bifactor and second-order models, and (d) suggest contexts where bifactor analysis is particularly valuable (e.g., for evaluating the plausibility of subscales, determining the extent to which scores reflect a single variable even when the data are multidimensional, and evaluating the feasibility of applying a unidimensional item response theory (IRT) measurement model). We emphasize that the determination of dimensionality is a related but distinct question from either determining the extent to which scores reflect a single individual difference variable or determining the effect of multidimensionality on IRT item parameter estimates. Indeed, we suggest that in many contexts, multidimensional data can yield interpretable scale scores and be appropriately fitted to unidimensional IRT models. },

  abstract  = {Abstract The goal of the present study was to examine relationships between individual differences in resting state functional connectivity as ascertained by fMRI (rs-fcMRI) and performance on tasks of executive function (EF), broadly defined as the ability to regulate thoughts and actions. Unlike most previous research that focused on the relationship between rs-fcMRI and a single behavioral measure of EF, in the current study we examined the relationship of rs-fcMRI with individual differences in subcomponents of EF. Ninety-one adults completed a resting state fMRI scan and three separate EF tasks outside the magnet: inhibition of prepotent responses, task set shifting, and working memory updating. From these three measures, we derived estimates of common aspects of EF, as well as abilities specific to working memory updating and task shifting. Using Independent Components Analysis (ICA), we identified across the group of participants several networks of regions (Resting State Networks, RSNs) with temporally correlated time courses. We then used dual regression to explore how these RSNs covaried with individual differences in EF. Dual regression revealed that increased higher common EF was associated with connectivity of a) frontal pole with an attentional RSN, and b) Crus I and II of the cerebellum with the right frontoparietal RSN. Moreover, higher shifting-specific abilities were associated with increased connectivity of angular gyrus with a ventral attention RSN.

This article summarizes the EF research that our group has conducted to understand the nature of individual differences in EFs and their cognitive and biological underpinnings. In the context of a new theoretical framework that we have been developing (the unity/diversity framework), we describe four general conclusions that have emerged. Specifically, we argue that individual differences in EFs, as measured with simple laboratory tasks, (a) show both unity and diversity (different EFs are correlated yet separable), (b) reflect substantial genetic contributions, (c) are related to various clinically and societally important phenomena, and (d) show some developmental stability.

  abstract  = {Like all perception, social perception reflects evolutionary pressures. In encounters with conspecifics, social animals must determine, immediately, whether the ‘other’ is friend or foe (i.e. intends good or ill) and, then, whether the ‘other’ has the ability to enact those intentions. New data confirm these two universal dimensions of social cognition: warmth and competence. Promoting survival, these dimensions provide fundamental social structural answers about competition and status. People perceived as warm and competent elicit uniformly positive emotions and behavior, whereas those perceived as lacking warmth and competence elicit uniform negativity. People classified as high on one dimension and low on the other elicit predictable, ambivalent affective and behavioral reactions. These universal dimensions explain both interpersonal and intergroup social cognition.},

  abstract  = {Though many neuroscientific methods have been brought to bear in the search for functional specializations within prefrontal cortex, little consensus has emerged. To assess the contribution of functional neuroimaging, this article reviews patterns of frontal-lobe activation associated with a broad range of different cognitive demands, including aspects of perception, response selection, executive control, working memory, episodic memory and problem solving. The results show a striking regularity: for many demands, there is a similar recruitment of mid-dorsolateral, mid-ventrolateral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Much of the remainder of frontal cortex, including most of the medial and orbital surfaces, is largely insensitive to these demands. Undoubtedly, these results provide strong evidence for regional specialization of function within prefrontal cortex. This specialization, however, takes an unexpected form: a specific frontal-lobe network that is consistently recruited for solution of diverse cognitive problems. },

  abstract  = {Response inhibition plays a critical role in adaptive functioning and can be assessed with the Stop-signal task, which requires participants to suppress prepotent motor responses. Evidence suggests that this ability to inhibit a motor response that has already been initiated (reflected as Stop-signal reaction time (SSRT)) is a quantitative and heritable measure of interindividual variation in brain function. In order to examine the reliability of this measure, we pooled data across three separate studies and examined the influence of multiple SSRT calculation methods and outlier calling on reliability (using Intra-class correlation). Our results suggest that an approach which uses the average of all available sessions, all trials of each session, and excludes outliers based on predetermined lenient criteria yields reliable SSRT estimates, while not excluding too many participants. Our findings support the reliability of SSRT as an index of inhibitory control, and provide support for its continued use as a neurocognitive phenotype.
