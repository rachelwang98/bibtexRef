  abstract  = {Currently, there is debate among scholars regarding how to operationalize
	and measure executive functions. These functions generally are referred
	to as "supervisory" cognitive processes because they involve higher
	level organization and execution of complex thoughts and behavior.
	Although conceptualizations vary regarding what mental processes
	actually constitute the "executive function" construct, there has
	been a historical linkage of these "higher-level" processes with
	the frontal lobes. In fact, many investigators have used the term
	"frontal functions" synonymously with "executive functions" despite
	evidence that contradicts this synonymous usage. The current review
	provides a critical analysis of lesion and neuroimaging studies using
	three popular executive function measures {(Wisconsin} Card Sorting
	Test, Phonemic Verbal Fluency, and Stroop Color Word Interference
	Test) in order to examine the validity of the executive function
	construct in terms of its relation to activation and damage to the
	frontal lobes. Empirical lesion data are examined via meta-analysis
	procedures along with formula derivatives. Results reveal mixed evidence
	that does not support a one-to-one relationship between executive
	functions and frontal lobe activity. The paper concludes with a discussion
	of the implications of construing the validity of these neuropsychological
	tests in anatomical, rather than cognitive and behavioral, terms.},

	Rational, and Social Bands. The 10 millisecond effects reside in

	The unit-task level, at the boundary of the Cognitive and Rational
	Bands, is useful for assessing these theses. There is good evidence
	for all three theses in efforts that bridge from the unit-task level

  abstract  = {This review paper outlines the issues associated with the assessment
	of executive function {(EF)} in children and adolescents, and describes
	the developmental profile of executive processes across childhood.
	At the outset, {EF} is defined, and cognitive and behavioral impairments
	associated with executive dysfunction {(EDF)} are described. A developmental
	model of {EF} is proposed incorporating four discrete but inter-related
	executive domains (attentional control, cognitive flexibility, goal
	setting, and information processing) which operate in an integrative
	manner to enable "executive control". Characteristics that constitute
	traditional {EF} measures are discussed, as are the problems associated
	with test interpretation. The ecological validity of {EF} tests and
	neuropsychological assessment procedures are examined, and adjunct
	methods of measurement are presented to enable a more comprehensive
	and valid assessment of {EF.} Based on developmental and normative
	studies, the maturation of executive domains is mapped. Attentional
	control appears to emerge in infancy and develop rapidly in early
	childhood. In contrast, cognitive flexibility, goal setting, and
	information processing experience a critical period of development
	between 7 and 9 years of age, and are relatively mature by 12 years
	of age. A transitional period is thought to occur at the beginning
	of adolescence, and shortly after "executive control" is likely to
	emerge. In order to confirm our current understanding of {EF} development
	and further enhance our understanding of brain-behavior relationships,
	longitudinal studies incorporating structural and functional neuroimaging

	adults; 50\% female). All were tested on the same computerized battery,
	designed to manipulate memory and inhibition independently and together,
	in steady state (single-task blocks) and during task-switching, and
	to be appropriate over the lifespan and for neuroimaging {(fMRI).}
	This is one of the first studies, in children or adults, to explore:
	(a) how memory requirements interact with spatial compatibility and
	(b) spatial incompatibility effects both with stimulus-specific rules
	{(Simon} task) and with higher-level, conceptual rules. Even the
	youngest children could hold information in mind, inhibit a dominant
	response, and combine those as long as the inhibition required was
	steady-state and the rules remained constant. Cognitive flexibility
	(switching between rules), even with memory demands minimized, showed
	a longer developmental progression, with 13-year-olds still not at
	adult levels. Effects elicited only in Mixed blocks with adults were
	found in young children even in single-task blocks; while young children
	could exercise inhibition in steady state it exacted a cost not seen
	in adults, who (unlike young children) seemed to re-set their default
	response when inhibition of the same tendency was required throughout
	a block. The costs associated with manipulations of inhibition were
	greater in young children while the costs associated with increasing

	children were impulsive; their {RT} remained more constant but at
	an accuracy cost on difficult trials. Contrary to our predictions
	of independence between memory and inhibition, when matched for difficulty

	correlations were less than half that. Spatial incompatibility effects

  abstract  = {Research and clinical investigations in psychiatry largely rely on
	the de facto assumption that the diagnostic categories identified
	in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual {(DSM)} represent homogeneous
	syndromes. However, the mechanistic heterogeneity that potentially
	underlies the existing classification scheme might limit discovery
	of etiology for most developmental psychiatric disorders. Another,
	perhaps less palpable, reality may also be interfering with progress-heterogeneity
	in typically developing populations. In this report we attempt to
	clarify neuropsychological heterogeneity in a large dataset of typically
	developing youth and youth with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
	{(ADHD),} using graph theory and community detection. We sought to
	determine whether data-driven neuropsychological subtypes could be
	discerned in children with and without the disorder. Because individual
	classification is the sine qua non for eventual clinical translation,
	we also apply support vector machine-based multivariate pattern analysis
	to identify how well {ADHD} status in individual children can be
	identified as defined by the community detection delineated subtypes.
	The analysis yielded several unique, but similar subtypes across
	both populations. Just as importantly, comparing typically developing
	children with {ADHD} children within each of these distinct subgroups
	increased diagnostic accuracy. Two important principles were identified
	that have the potential to advance our understanding of typical development
	and developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. The first tenet suggests
	that typically developing children can be classified into distinct
	neuropsychological subgroups with high precision. The second tenet
	proposes that some of the heterogeneity in individuals with {ADHD}
	might be "nested" in this normal variation.},

  abstract  = {Structural equation modeling {(SEM)} is increasingly being chosen
	by researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from
	the quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging
	from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical
	modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability,
	and even purpose of {SEM.} Guidelines for implementing the expanded
	capabilities of {SEM} are currently lacking. In this paper we describe
	new developments in {SEM} that we believe constitute a third-generation
	of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the
	generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph.
	In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles
	rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels
	and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries
	and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a
	graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood
	methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the
	goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling
	process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification
	choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options,
	and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for
	prospective analyses. The illustrative example presented involves
	monitoring data from wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia
	National Park. Our presentation walks through the decision process
	involved in developing and evaluating models, as well as drawing
	inferences from the resulting prediction equations. In addition to
	evaluating hypotheses about the connections between human activities
	and biotic responses, we illustrate how the structural equation {(SE)}
	model can be queried to understand how interventions might take advantage
	of an environmental threshold to limit Typha invasions. The guidelines
	presented provide for an updated definition of the {SEM} process
	that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a graph-theory
	implementation. The implementation is also designed to permit complex
	specifications and to be compatible with various estimation methods.
	Finally, they are meant to foster the use of probabilistic reasoning
	in both retrospective and prospective considerations of the quantitative
	implications of the results.},

  abstract  = {Developmental studies have shown that visuo-spatial working memory
	{(VSWM)} performance improves throughout childhood and adolescence
	into young adulthood. The neural basis of this protracted development
	is poorly understood. In this study, we used functional {MRI} {(fMRI)}
	to examine {VSWM} function in children, adolescents, and young adults,
	ages 7-22. Subjects performed a 2-back {VSWM} experiment that required
	dynamic storage and manipulation of spatial information. Accuracy
	and response latency on the {VSWM} task improved gradually, extending
	into young adulthood. Age-related increases in brain activation were
	observed in focal regions of the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal
	cortex, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (including Broca's area),
	left premotor cortex, and left and right posterior parietal cortex.
	Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relative contributions
	of age, accuracy, and response latency on activation. Our analysis
	showed that age was the most significant predictor of activation
	in these brain regions. These findings provide strong evidence for
	a process of protracted functional maturation of bilateral fronto-parietal
	neural networks involved in {VSWM} development. At least two neural
	systems involved in {VSWM} mature together: (i) a right hemisphere
	visuo-spatial attentional system, and (ii) a left hemisphere phonological
	storage and rehearsal system. These observations suggest that visually
	and verbally mediated mnemonic processes, and their neural representations,
	develop concurrently during childhood and adolescence and into young
	adulthood.},

	The increase in working memory load did not impact the type of dynamics

	These findings highlight that the development of the temporal dynamics

	during electroencephalographic {(EEG)} measurements, go underutilized.
	We present an automatic, auto-calibrating algorithm that allows efficient
	analysis of such data sets. Methods The auto-calibration is based
	on automatic threshold value estimation. Amplitude threshold values
	for saccades and blinks are determined based on features in the recorded
	signal. The performance of the developed algorithm was tested by
	analyzing 4854 saccades and 213 blinks recorded in two different
	conditions: a task where the eye movements were controlled (saccade
	task) and a task with free viewing (multitask). The results were
	compared with results from a video-oculography {(VOG)} device and
	manually scored blinks. Results The algorithm achieved 93\% detection
	sensitivity for blinks with 4\% false positive rate. The detection
	sensitivity for horizontal saccades was between 98\% and 100\%, and
	for oblique saccades between 95\% and 100\%. The classification sensitivity
	for horizontal and large oblique saccades (10 deg) was larger than
	89\%, and for vertical saccades larger than 82\%. The duration and
	peak velocities of the detected horizontal saccades were similar
	to those in the literature. In the multitask measurement the detection
	sensitivity for saccades was 97\% with a 6\% false positive rate.
	Conclusion The developed algorithm enables reliable analysis of {EOG}
	data recorded both during {EEG} and as a separate metrics.},

	both measures yield similar pattern of results supporting the "principle
	of inverse effectiveness". The second experiment, introducing stimulus
	onset asynchrony and differing instructions (focused attention vs.
	redundant targets task) further supports the usefulness of both indices.

	large reward (10 cents) varied in likelihood, with probabilities

  abstract  = {The role of the frontal lobes has often been described as a ‘paradox�?
	or a ‘riddle�?. Ascribed to this region has been the loftiest of
	functions (e.g. executive; seat of wisdom); others contested that
	the frontal lobes played no special role. There has also been controversy
	about the unity or diversity of functions related to the frontal
	lobes. Based on the analysis of the effects of lesions of the frontal
	lobes, we propose that there are discrete categories of functions
	within the frontal lobes, of which ‘executive�? functioning is one.
	Within the executive category, the data do not support the concept
	of an undifferentiated central executive/supervisory system. The
	results are better explained as impairments in a collection of anatomically
	and functionally independent but interrelated attentional control
	processes. Evidence for three separate frontal attentional processes
	is presented. For each process, we present an operational description,
	the data supporting the distinctiveness of each process and the evidence
	for impairments of each process after lesions in specific frontal
	regions. These processes and their coarse frontal localizations are
	energization—superior medial, task setting—left lateral and monitoring—right
	lateral. The strength of the findings lies in replication: across
	different tasks; across different cognitive modalities (e.g. reaction
	time paradigms, memory); and across different patient groups. This
	convergence minimizes the possibility that any of the findings are
	limited to a specific task or to a specific set of patients. Although
	distinct, these processes are flexibly assembled in response to context,
	complexity and intention over real time into different networks within
	the frontal regions and between frontal and posterior regions.},

	50 children with {ADHD} (31 {ADHD,} 19 {ADHD+RD)} and age-matched
	healthy controls (n~=~50) completed three psychophysical tasks: duration
	discrimination (target duration of 400 ms versus a foil duration),

	of reproduction for intervals of 400 ms, 2000 ms, and 6000 ms. Study
	2 used the same tasks with an adolescent sample (35 {ADHD,} 24 {ADHD+RD,}
	39 controls). Results: In both studies, children and adolescents
	with {ADHD} and {ADHD+RD} displayed some impairments in duration
	discrimination and the precision with which they reproduced the intervals
	on the estimation task, particularly the shorter 400 ms interval.
	The most severe impairments tended to occur in the comorbid {ADHD+RD}
	group. No impairments were found on the frequency discrimination
	task. {ADHD} participants also displayed significant intra-individual
	variability in their performance on the estimation task. Finally,
	short-term and working memory, estimated full-scale {IQ,} and teacher
	report of hyperactivity/impulsivity were found to differentially
	predict performance on the time perception measures in the adolescent
	clinical sample. Conclusions: Deficits in duration discrimination,

	than magnitude comparison. In two experiments, we observed a robust

	constructing or instantiating a version of the chosen strategy to
	enable performance on the task; (3) controlling and coordinating
	execution of the strategy during real-time performance on the task;
	and (4) disabling or disengaging the strategy in response to changes
	in goals or changes in the task environment that make the current
	strategy inappropriate. This paper presents a selective review of
	research addressing each of these executive functions, focusing on
	the time and resources used to accomplish each one.},

  abstract  = {Two competing theoretical models of individual differences in executive functioning (EF) were examined: the Prefrontal Convexity Model and the Hemispheric Asymmetry Model. Neurologically healthy individuals (N = 315; mean age 20.8) completed a modified switching task (MST) and the Attention Network Test (ANT) in a single testing session. Data analysis was conducted in two phases. In the first phase (model identification), latent profile analysis was applied to MST variables measuring the abilities to form, switch, and maintain mental sets under conditions designed to tax left or right hemisphere resources. In the second phase (model validation), participant clusters obtained from the first phase were compared on the ANT. The Model Identification phase yielded a 3-profile solution consistent with the Hemispheric Asymmetry Model. Profile 1 (N = 203) was characterized by average EF performances. Profile 2 (N = 43) revealed a set maintenance weakness under non-verbal conditions. Profile 3 (N = 38) demonstrated weaknesses in cognitive flexibility combined with poor executive performances under verbal conditions. The Model Validation phase confirmed group differences. Profile 1 demonstrated average EF performances. Profile 2 demonstrated distractibility and decreased alertness, consistent with a right hemisphere weakness. Profile 3 demonstrated cognitive rigidity in the absence of external cues, consistent with a left hemisphere weakness. Individual differences in EF appear to follow a Hemispheric Asymmetry Model of EF among neurologically healthy adults. Investigating the relationship between hemispherically mediated executive functions and other individual difference factors known to confer health risk or resilience could inform numerous disciplines within the field of psychology.},

  abstract  = {Background: Diagnostic and prognostic or predictive models serve different purposes. Whereas diagnostic models are usually used for classification, prognostic models incorporate the dimension of time, adding a stochastic element. Content: The ROC curve is typically used to evaluate clinical utility for both diagnostic and prognostic models. This curve assesses how well a test or model discriminates, or separates individuals into two classes, such as diseased and nondiseased. A strong risk predictor, such as lipids for cardiovascular disease, may have limited impact on the area under the curve, called the AUC or c-statistic, even if it alters predicted values. Calibration, measuring whether predicted probabilities agree with observed proportions, is another component of model accuracy important to assess. Reclassification can directly compare the clinical impact of two models by determining how many individuals would be reclassified into clinically relevant risk strata. For example, adding high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and family history to prediction models for cardiovascular disease using traditional risk factors moves approximately 30\% of those at intermediate risk levels, such as 5\%{\textendash}10\% or 10\%{\textendash}20\% 10-year risk, into higher or lower risk categories, despite little change in the c-statistic. A calibration statistic can asses how well the new predicted values agree with those observed in the cross-classified data. Summary: Although it is useful for classification, evaluation of prognostic models should not rely solely on the ROC curve, but should assess both discrimination and calibration. Risk reclassification can aid in comparing the clinical impact of two models on risk for the individual, as well as the population.},

  abstract  = {Anxious stress compromises cognitive executive performance. This occurs, for instance, in cognitive performance anxiety (CPA), in which anxiety about one's cognitive performance causes that performance to actually deteriorate (e.g., test anxiety). This is thought to result from a prefrontal cortically (PFC) mediated failure of top-down attentional control over stress-induced automatic processing of threat-related information. In addition, stress-induced increased catecholamine influx into the PFC may directly compromise attentional function. Previous research has suggested that the ratio between resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) low- and high-frequency power (the theta/beta ratio) is related to trait attentional control, which might moderate these effects of stress on attentional function. The goals of the present study were to test the novel prediction that theta/beta ratio moderates the deleterious effects of CPA-like anxious stress on state attentional control and to replicate a previous finding that the theta/beta ratio is related to self-reported trait attentional control. After recording of baseline frontal EEG signals, 77 participants performed a stress induction or a control procedure. Trait attentional control was assessed with the Attentional Control Scale, whereas stress-induced changes in attentional control and anxiety were measured with self-report visual analogue scales. The hypothesized moderating influence of theta/beta ratio on the effects of stress on state attentional control was confirmed. Theta/beta ratio explained 28{\%} of the variance in stress-induced deterioration of self-reported attentional control. The negative relationship between theta/beta ratio and trait attentional control was replicated (r = --.33). The theta/beta ratio reflects, likely prefrontally mediated, attentional control, and should be a useful biomarker for the study of CPA and other anxiety--cognition interactions.},

  abstract  = {Abstract This survey covers the potential use of neurophysiological changes as a biomarker in four neuropsychiatric diseases (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ)). Great developments have been made in the search of biomarkers in these disorders, especially in AD. Nevertheless, there is a tremendous need to develop an efficient, low-cost, potentially portable, non-invasive biomarker in the diagnosis, course, or treatment of the above-mentioned disorders. Electrophysiological methods would provide a tool that would reflect functional brain dynamic changes within milliseconds and also may be used as an ensemble of biomarkers that is greatly needed in the evaluation of cognitive changes seen in these disorders. The strategies for measuring cognitive changes include spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG), sensory evoked oscillation (SEO), and event-related oscillations (ERO). Further selective connectivity deficit in sensory or cognitive networks is reflected by coherence measurements. Possible candidate biomarkers discussed in an interactive panel can be summarized as follows: for ADHD: (a) elevation of delta and theta, (b) diminished alpha and beta responses in spontaneous EEG; for SZ: (a) decrease of \{ERO\} gamma responses, (b) decreased \{ERO\} in all other frequency ranges, (c) invariant \{ERO\} gamma response in relation to working memory demand; for euthymic BD: (a) decreased event-related gamma coherence, (b) decreased alpha in \{ERO\} and in spontaneous EEG; for manic BD: (a) lower alpha and higher beta in ERO, (b) decreased event-related gamma coherence, (c) lower alpha and beta in \{ERO\} after valproate; and for AD: (a) decreased alpha and beta, and increased theta and delta in spontaneous EEG, (b) hyperexcitability of motor cortices as shown by transcortical magnetic stimulation, (c) hyperexcitability of visual sensory cortex as indicated by increased \{SEO\} theta responses, (d) lower delta ERO, (e) lower delta, theta, and alpha event-related coherence, (f) higher theta synchrony and higher alpha event-related coherence in cholinergically treated \{AD\} subjects. In further research in the search for biomarkers, multimodal methods should be introduced to electrophysiology for validation purposes. Also, providing the protocols for standardization and harmonization of user-friendly acquisition or analysis methods that would be applied in larger cohort populations should be used to incorporate these electrophysiologic methods into the clinical criteria. In an extension to conventional anatomical, biochemical and brain imaging biomarkers, the use of neurophysiologic markers may lead to new applications for functional interpretrations and also the possibility to monitor treatments tailored for individuals.},

  abstract  = {Executive dysfunction has been postulated as the core deficit in ADHD, although many deficits in lower order cognitive processes have also been identified. By obtaining an appropriate baseline of lower order cognitive functioning light may be shed on as to whether executive deficits result from problems in lower order and/or higher order cognitive processes. We examined motor inhibition and cognitive flexibility in relation to a baseline measure in 816 children from ADHD and control families. Multiple children in a family were tested in order to examine the familiality of the measures. No evidence was found for deficits in motor inhibition or cognitive flexibility in children with ADHD or their nonaffected siblings: Compared to their baseline speed and accuracy of responding, children with ADHD and their (non)affected siblings were not disproportionally slower or inaccurate when demands for motor inhibition or cognitive flexibility were added to the task. However, children with ADHD and their (non)affected siblings were overall less accurate than controls, which could not be attributed to differences in response speed. This suggests that inaccuracy of responding is characteristic of children having (a familial risk for) ADHD. Motor inhibition and cognitive flexibility as operationalized with mean reaction time were found to be familial. It is concluded that poorer performance on executive tasks in children with ADHD and their (non)affected siblings may result from deficiencies in lower order cognitive processes and not (only) from higher order cognitive processes/executive functions.},

However, a precise characterization of these reconfiguration processes during cognitive function in humans remains elusive. Here, we use a series of techniques developed in the field of “dynamic network neuroscience” to investigate the dynamics of functional brain networks in 344 healthy subjects during a working-memory challenge (the “n-back” task). In contrast to a control condition, in which dynamic changes in cortical networks were spread evenly across systems, the effortful working-memory condition was characterized by a reconfiguration of frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks. This reconfiguration, which characterizes “network flexibility,” employs transient and heterogeneous connectivity between frontal systems, which we refer to as “integration.” Frontal integration predicted neuropsychological measures requiring working memory and executive cognition, suggesting that dynamic network reconfiguration between frontal systems supports those functions. Our results characterize dynamic reconfiguration of large-scale distributed neural circuits during executive cognition in humans and have implications for understanding impaired cognitive function in disorders affecting connectivity, such as schizophrenia or dementia.},

               Objective: To measure test -retest reliability of the Stop-Signal Task (SST) and the Conners’ Continuous Performance Test (CPT) in children with ADHD. Methods: 12 children with ADHD (age 11.46 ±1.66) participated in the study. Primary outcome measures were stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) for the SST and CPT’s commission errors (%FP). For each participant, we acquired three morning (8:00am) measurements and behavioral observations, separated by two 7-day intervals. Reliability of cognitive measures and behavioral observations was measured using the Intraclass-correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: ICC values for SSRT and %FP were 0.72. Consistency of behavioral observations was much lower (ICC =0.41). Conclusion: Both the SST and the CPT yielded reliable measurements in ADHD children. Our findings lend further support to using these measures in the study of ADHD. (J. of Att. Dis. 2009; 13(2) 137-143)

Significant, positive correlations between the CCPT parameters and behavioral ratings of ADHD behaviors were hypothesized. In addition, it was hypothesized that the CCPT parameters would perform better than a random test (chance) and show fair to moderate utility of classification across the different indices. Participants were 104 children between 6 and 12 years of age who were referred for evaluation of attention problems. The first hypothesis was not supported. There were no significant, positive correlations between the CCPT parameters and parent and teacher ratings of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive behaviors. The second hypothesis was only partially supported. The CCPT Overall Index and the Omission Errors (84th percentile cutoff) performed better than a random test; however, the utility of the CCPT Overall Index only ranged from poor to slight. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed the accuracy of the CCPT to be low. The implications and limitations of this study and future research directions are discussed.},

The neural mechanisms of cognitive control have yet to be fully elucidated, although the prefrontal cortex is known to play a critical role. Here, I review evidence suggesting that a unifying principle regarding the role of various portions of the prefrontal cortex in a wide range of cognitive tasks is the active maintenance in working memory of different types of currently relevant information---from specific stimulus features, to instructional cues, to motivational goals and contexts. I argue that the key to demonstrating the existence of this domain-dependent organization lies in a better understanding of the nature of the representation of this information and the ways in which this information itself controls cognition and behavior.},
