  abstract = {Currently, there is debate among scholars regarding how to operationalize
	and measure executive functions. These functions generally are referred
	to as "supervisory" cognitive processes because they involve higher
	level organization and execution of complex thoughts and behavior.
	Although conceptualizations vary regarding what mental processes
	actually constitute the "executive function" construct, there has
	been a historical linkage of these "higher-level" processes with
	the frontal lobes. In fact, many investigators have used the term
	"frontal functions" synonymously with "executive functions" despite
	evidence that contradicts this synonymous usage. The current review
	provides a critical analysis of lesion and neuroimaging studies using
	three popular executive function measures {(Wisconsin} Card Sorting
	Test, Phonemic Verbal Fluency, and Stroop Color Word Interference
	Test) in order to examine the validity of the executive function
	construct in terms of its relation to activation and damage to the
	frontal lobes. Empirical lesion data are examined via meta-analysis
	procedures along with formula derivatives. Results reveal mixed evidence
	that does not support a one-to-one relationship between executive
	functions and frontal lobe activity. The paper concludes with a discussion
	of the implications of construing the validity of these neuropsychological
	tests in anatomical, rather than cognitive and behavioral, terms.},

	Rational, and Social Bands. The 10 millisecond effects reside in
	his Biological Band while the significant learning outcomes reside

	The unit-task level, at the boundary of the Cognitive and Rational
	Bands, is useful for assessing these theses. There is good evidence
	for all three theses in efforts that bridge from the unit-task level

	At the outset, {EF} is defined, and cognitive and behavioral impairments
	associated with executive dysfunction {(EDF)} are described. A developmental
	model of {EF} is proposed incorporating four discrete but inter-related
	executive domains (attentional control, cognitive flexibility, goal
	setting, and information processing) which operate in an integrative
	manner to enable "executive control". Characteristics that constitute
	traditional {EF} measures are discussed, as are the problems associated
	with test interpretation. The ecological validity of {EF} tests and
	neuropsychological assessment procedures are examined, and adjunct
	methods of measurement are presented to enable a more comprehensive
	and valid assessment of {EF.} Based on developmental and normative
	studies, the maturation of executive domains is mapped. Attentional
	control appears to emerge in infancy and develop rapidly in early
	childhood. In contrast, cognitive flexibility, goal setting, and
	information processing experience a critical period of development
	between 7 and 9 years of age, and are relatively mature by 12 years
	of age. A transitional period is thought to occur at the beginning
	of adolescence, and shortly after "executive control" is likely to

	inhibition phenotype is a particularly good candidate for future

	caused by normal subject respiration and, in some studies, movement

	Optimization of the {fMRI} data-processing pipeline to compensate
	for geometric distortions is of paramount importance to ensure high
	quality of {fMRI} data. To investigate {ΔB0} caused by subject movement,
	echo-planar imaging scans were collected with and without concurrent
	motion of a phantom arm. The phantom arm was constructed and moved
	by the experimenter to emulate forearm motions while subjects remained
	still and observed a visual stimulation paradigm. These data were
	then subjected to eight different combinations of preprocessing steps.
	The best preprocessing pipeline included navigator correction, a
	complex phase regressor and spatial smoothing. The synergy between
	navigator correction and phase regression reduced geometric distortions
	better than either step in isolation and preconditioned the data
	to make them more amenable to the benefits of spatial smoothing.
	The combination of these steps provided a 10\% increase in t-statistics

	to be appropriate over the lifespan and for neuroimaging {(fMRI).}
	This is one of the first studies, in children or adults, to explore:
	(a) how memory requirements interact with spatial compatibility and
	(b) spatial incompatibility effects both with stimulus-specific rules
	{(Simon} task) and with higher-level, conceptual rules. Even the

	response, and combine those as long as the inhibition required was
	steady-state and the rules remained constant. Cognitive flexibility
	(switching between rules), even with memory demands minimized, showed

	adult levels. Effects elicited only in Mixed blocks with adults were
	found in young children even in single-task blocks; while young children
	could exercise inhibition in steady state it exacted a cost not seen
	in adults, who (unlike young children) seemed to re-set their default
	response when inhibition of the same tendency was required throughout

	underlies the existing classification scheme might limit discovery

	clarify neuropsychological heterogeneity in a large dataset of typically
	developing youth and youth with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
	{(ADHD),} using graph theory and community detection. We sought to
	determine whether data-driven neuropsychological subtypes could be
	discerned in children with and without the disorder. Because individual
	classification is the sine qua non for eventual clinical translation,
	we also apply support vector machine-based multivariate pattern analysis
	to identify how well {ADHD} status in individual children can be
	identified as defined by the community detection delineated subtypes.
	The analysis yielded several unique, but similar subtypes across
	both populations. Just as importantly, comparing typically developing
	children with {ADHD} children within each of these distinct subgroups
	increased diagnostic accuracy. Two important principles were identified
	that have the potential to advance our understanding of typical development
	and developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. The first tenet suggests
	that typically developing children can be classified into distinct
	neuropsychological subgroups with high precision. The second tenet
	proposes that some of the heterogeneity in individuals with {ADHD}
	might be "nested" in this normal variation.},

  abstract = {Structural equation modeling {(SEM)} is increasingly being chosen
	by researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from
	the quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging
	from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical
	modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability,
	and even purpose of {SEM.} Guidelines for implementing the expanded
	capabilities of {SEM} are currently lacking. In this paper we describe
	new developments in {SEM} that we believe constitute a third-generation
	of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the
	generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph.
	In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles
	rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels
	and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries
	and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a
	graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood
	methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the
	goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling
	process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification
	choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options,
	and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for
	prospective analyses. The illustrative example presented involves
	monitoring data from wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia
	National Park. Our presentation walks through the decision process
	involved in developing and evaluating models, as well as drawing
	inferences from the resulting prediction equations. In addition to
	evaluating hypotheses about the connections between human activities
	and biotic responses, we illustrate how the structural equation {(SE)}
	model can be queried to understand how interventions might take advantage
	of an environmental threshold to limit Typha invasions. The guidelines
	presented provide for an updated definition of the {SEM} process
	that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a graph-theory
	implementation. The implementation is also designed to permit complex
	specifications and to be compatible with various estimation methods.
	Finally, they are meant to foster the use of probabilistic reasoning
	in both retrospective and prospective considerations of the quantitative
	implications of the results.},

	It provides both a cross-sectional, as well as a longitudinal exploration

	control mechanisms, assessed via children’s performance on memory
	storage tasks, and influenced by individual differences in anxiety.
	Multiple measures of verbal and visuospatial short-term memory {(STM)}

	a nonverbal measure of intelligence, and a parental report of anxiety
	symptoms. After 9 months, children were re-tested on the same {STM}

	analyzing 4854 saccades and 213 blinks recorded in two different
	conditions: a task where the eye movements were controlled (saccade
	task) and a task with free viewing (multitask). The results were
	compared with results from a video-oculography {(VOG)} device and
	manually scored blinks. Results The algorithm achieved 93\% detection

	sensitivity for horizontal saccades was between 98\% and 100\%, and
	for oblique saccades between 95\% and 100\%. The classification sensitivity

	suggest an integration of {RT} and {DR} into a single measure of
	multisensory performance: the first index {(MRE*)} is based on an
	arithmetic combination of {RT} and {DR,} the second {(MPE)} is constructed
	from parameters derived from fitting a sequential sampling model
	to {RT} and {DR} data simultaneously. Our approach is illustrated
	by data from two audio-visual experiments. In the first, a redundant
	targets detection experiment using stimuli of different intensity,
	both measures yield similar pattern of results supporting the "principle
	of inverse effectiveness". The second experiment, introducing stimulus
	onset asynchrony and differing instructions (focused attention vs.
	redundant targets task) further supports the usefulness of both indices.
	Statistical properties of both measures are investigated via bootstrapping
	procedures.},

	(10 cents) was delayed by between 0 and 30s, and the immediate reward
	varied in magnitude (0�?10 cents). In the {PD} task, receipt of the
	large reward (10 cents) varied in likelihood, with probabilities
	of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 used, and the certain reward varied

	choosing the immediate reward did not shorten overall task duration.
	This, together with the lack of interaction between {TD} task version

	refers to the suppression of actions that are no longer required
	or that are inappropriate, which supports flexible and goal-directed
	behavior in ever-changing environments. The stop-signal paradigm
	is most suitable for the study of response inhibition in a laboratory
	setting. The paradigm has become increasingly popular in cognitive
	psychology, cognitive neuroscience and psychopathology. We review
	recent findings in the stop-signal literature with the specific aim
	of demonstrating how each of these different fields contributes to
	a better understanding of the processes involved in inhibiting a
	response and monitoring stopping performance, and more generally,
	discovering how behavior is controlled.},

	a distance effect (close numbers are more difficult to compare than

	difficulty increases with increasing size). The distance effect indicates
	access to the mental number line {(Dehaene,} 1997), and the size
	effect is usually interpreted as indicating that the mental number
	line represents larger numbers more vaguely than smaller ones. In
	contrast, we have argued earlier {(Verguts,} Fias, \& Stevens, 2005)
	that for symbolic numbers {(Arabic} or verbal notation), the size
	effect does not originate from the mental number line but, instead,
	originates from mappings to relevant output components that are specific
	for magnitude comparison. If the latter is true, it should be possible
	to dissociate the distance effect from the size effect in tasks other
	than magnitude comparison. In two experiments, we observed a robust
	distance effect in same/different judgments, which implies access
	to the mental number line. Yet the size effect was absent. Consistent
	with our prediction, this finding establishes a dissociation between
	the size effect and the distance effect.},

Neurologically healthy individuals (N = 315; mean age 20.8) completed a modified switching task (MST) and the Attention Network Test (ANT) in a single testing session. Data analysis was conducted in two phases. In the first phase (model identification), latent profile analysis was applied to MST variables measuring the abilities to form, switch, and maintain mental sets under conditions designed to tax left or right hemisphere resources. In the second phase (model validation), participant clusters obtained from the first phase were compared on the ANT. The Model Identification phase yielded a 3-profile solution consistent with the Hemispheric Asymmetry Model. Profile 1 (N = 203) was characterized by average EF performances. Profile 2 (N = 43) revealed a set maintenance weakness under non-verbal conditions. Profile 3 (N = 38) demonstrated weaknesses in cognitive flexibility combined with poor executive performances under verbal conditions. The Model Validation phase confirmed group differences. Profile 1 demonstrated average EF performances. Profile 2 demonstrated distractibility and decreased alertness, consistent with a right hemisphere weakness. Profile 3 demonstrated cognitive rigidity in the absence of external cues, consistent with a left hemisphere weakness. Individual differences in EF appear to follow a Hemispheric Asymmetry Model of EF among neurologically healthy adults. Investigating the relationship between hemispherically mediated executive functions and other individual difference factors known to confer health risk or resilience could inform numerous disciplines within the field of psychology.},
